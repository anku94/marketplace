===========

This website is gonna use some CSS, some JS, some jQuery, and of course, HTML.

Since I doubt if anyone but me and partner (Hello, Nehal!) is gonna go through this, I am just going to list the work that needs to be done here.

-------------------------
All the stuff in the directories is empty/fake/not required. All the code is in the index.html and both image files required are in the root.

First, all the stuff has to be organized. The CSS is entirely in the index.html, and needs to be moved to its own style sheet. The images have to be moved to their own folder.

The CSS is, I hope, generic and can be used for future web pages. The nav-sprites will be different for different pages so maybe we need to rename them appropriately.

There is some jQuery code at the bottom which calculates the dimensions of the window and sets the dimensions of the divs accordingly.

There are MAJOR compatibility issues with IE9 even now, despite the fact that there is absolutely nothing here, besides the layout.

We could - either not bother about those, or bother about those. Which would take some time.

There is another jQuery library, called jQuery UI. It has addClass and removeClass buttons which are, by default, animated. Those in jQuery are not, I guess. Those would be handy. Plus, we could take a look at the pre-existing widgets and stuff.

Nehal, please follow this format and update the README after every change. The latest update goes on top, so we do not have to scroll to the bottom everytime.

Let us get this done. Cheers.
